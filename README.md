Project Summary:
Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.Here we need to explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

Data Preprocessing: The pre-processing of data involves data cleaning, handling missing values and data transformation.

Data Interpretation: It involves finding patterns and analyzing the dependency of variables.
Conclusion & Recommendation: To summarize all the points and providing recommendation to the company

Conclusion of the Project

Overall Customer churn is 14.49%.
For Vmail messages Feature, when there are more than 15 voice-mail messages then certainly there is a churn.
Number of people Churned are higher in Texas(TX),Maryland (MD).
Customers who left the service provider spent more minutes in all types(day,night,eve,intl) of calls.
Customers spending more on the service tend to leave the company.
Total minutes(day,night,eve,intl) and Total charges(day,night,eve,intl)  have very high positive correlation.
Total day charge, total day minute and customer service calls are weakly correlated with Churn variable.
The factors responsible for the customer would be the quality of calls made by customers, satisfaction level for the service, Difference in charge rates, working style of customer service department.

Recommendations
It is recommended to identify behavioral patterns for customer churn. Telecom service providers should focus on  the insight tools and powerful analytics to predict churn of customers, find the patterns  of behavior followed by customers and conceive strategies that enhance profitability as well as retention. The customer retention strategies costs must be mapped with expected return on interest to prioritize investments effectively. Telecom firms have to realign their priorities around retention of customers.
Based on Data analysis, there would be some recommendations are as following:
Structure of charging policies needs to be re-evaluated.
Company can offer some discount or cashback offers to the Clients who have subscribed for plans above the specific limit of subscription plan decided by the company's analysis department, meanwhile policies should not affect profits of the company.
Need to Upgrade services to solve the call dropping issues and make smarter use of technologies like VoLTE to improve Voice Quality.
Company should consider the feedback coming from customers and take corrective actions on the same.
